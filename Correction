Several errors in the first uploaded codes were corrected. For example, missing R libraries and source files were added.
Also, in the codes for analyzing electicity data, X is converted to a matrix. This also fixed some errors.
However, all the corrections do not influence on the results in the paper
because those errors are occurred in the process of organizing and summarizing the codes for publication.
We sincerely appologize for the errors in the previous codes.
Sorry and thank you.
