Some errors in the previous codes are corrected. For example, missing R libraries and source files are added.
Also, in the codes for analyzing electicity data, X is converted to a matrix. This also fixes some of the existing errors.
However, all the corrections do not influence on the results in the paper
because those errors are occurred in the process of organizing and summarizing the codes for publification.
We sincerely appologize for the errors in the codes uploaded first.
Sorry and thank you.
