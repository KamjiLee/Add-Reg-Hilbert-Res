Some errors in the previous codes are corrected. For example, missing R libraries and source files are added.
Also, in the codes for analyzing electicity data, X is converted to a matrix. This fixes existing errors.
However, all the changes do not influence on the results in the paper.
Those errors occured in the process of organizing and summarizing the codes for the publification.
We sincerely appologize for the errors in the codes uploaded first.
Sorry and thank you.
