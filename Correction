Some errors in the previous codes are corrected. For example, missing R libraries and source files are added.
Also, for the codes for analyzing electicity data, X is converted to a matrix. This fixes existing errors.
All the changes in the codes do not influence on the results in the paper.
We are sorry for the previous errors in the first uploaded codes.
