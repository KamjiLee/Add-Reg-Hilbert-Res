Election data analyzed in the paper is not uploaded in this github because the data exists in https://github.com/OhmyNews/2017-Election.
This is a github website of the Korean newpaper company 'oh my news'.
They collected the data from several goverment websites. Therefore, the data is official.
Although the website is written in Korean, important columns names can be checked in English in our analyzing codes.
